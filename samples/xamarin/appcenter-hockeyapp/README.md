# HockeyApp for App Center
These apps provide a platform native app experience for installation of apps release via [Visual Studio App Center](https://www.visualstudio.com/app-center/).

We chose to utilize the [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) platform for these apps. The use of Xamarin provided us a tremendous benefit allowing us to produce 3 applications for 3 platforms from a single code base. We care deeply about UX. Xamarin was able to give us the ultimate flexibility, allowing us to mix and match techniques like Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin Forms maximizing our learning from building this app and getting us to market as fast as possible. 

# Why we Open Source
Visual Studio App Center believes in openness and deep engagement with our developer customers. When you utilize App Center for distribution you should be able to see the details of the app and code you recommend your users utilize. We want to be partners with you in delivering the best experience to your customers.

We belive in [eating our own dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). As such, we develop this at for App Center using App Center. Our CI system is fully based on App Center, utilizing cloud hosted builds for all platforms, the Test service to ensure the highest app quality, and distribution to enable fast beta access for all users. In addition we make heavy use of both crash and analytics to understand what is happening with our app after release, what the end user experience is once they have it install on their device.

And finally, we love to share how we work. Check out our application code, especially how we are making use of App Center. We hope that it can help you to quickly come up to speed in using App Center for your own applications.
